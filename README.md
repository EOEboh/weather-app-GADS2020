# weather-app-GADS2020
<h2>Assigned By:</h2>
This project represents Google Africa Developer's Scholarship phase 2 practice project.

<h2> Features</h2>
This is a weather app that display weather information on a search input;
the weather info contains basic weather details like the
<ul><li>Main Temperature</li>
<li>"Feel's Like" temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Icon depiction of the main temperature</li></ul>

The app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) which consists of a static offline page to give 
basic offline experience to the user.

Furthermore, the app consists of a web manifest to control the display of the website to the 
end user. The manifest includes an array of different sizes of display icons to adapt to different 
screens when installed on any device.
A theme color to give the main color display on the app, a background color were also set in the 
web manifest file.
The display is a standalone display.

On IOS and MacOS, Safari browser does not support web app manifest yet, so traditional IOS native 
meta tags has been added to the code(index.html).

A basic offline page with a panda picture and display message was added to ensure basic user offline 
experience.

An installable feature was added to make it installable into the user's device and behave just like a 
native app. If installed can as well be uninstalled just like any downloaded app.

<h2>Built With</h2>

No JavaScript or CSS framework or library was used.
